## Goal

Rebuild https://www.millerenvironmental.ca as a Next.js 16 App Router app under
`apps/miller-web/`, preserving every route and verbatim copy from the scrape,
while extending the **TransLine49° design system** (shipped in
`apps/transline49-web/`) so Miller reads as the **senior** brand it actually
is — not as a TL49 re-skin.

## Non-goals
- Re-writing copy. Verbatim port from the scrape; minor case/punctuation tidy only.
- Backend integrations (form submit, CMS, search). Forms behave as in TL49:
  client-side state, on-submit confirmation.
- Migrating WordPress media. Placeholder Unsplash photography until real
  assets are wired.
- Case-study detail and individual job-posting pages are stub routes.
- Animated stats counters. **The `StatsBand` section is removed entirely** —
  the live site shows `0+` because of broken CMS, and the round-2 reviewers
  agreed a "Data unavailable" placeholder reads worse than no section at all.
- Renaming `tl-*` CSS classes to `wo-*`. Round-2 reviewers correctly flagged
  this as vanity at high risk: 144 unique class tokens across 19 files, plus
  `@keyframes`, plus `data-tlgrid*` attributes, plus the shipped iOS-Safari
  cache-bust commit the user just made. The shared package keeps the
  historical `tl-` vocabulary; both apps consume it. One-line comment in the
  shared package documents the origin.

## 1. Architecture

### 1.1 Repo position

The package goes to **`apps/brand/`**, not `apps/shared/brand/`. The
existing workspaces glob (`apps/*` in the root `package.json`) is **not
recursive** — it would not pick up `apps/shared/brand/`. Relocating to
`apps/brand/` is one less moving part than rewriting the glob.

```
<repo root>/
├── apps/
│   ├── transline49-web/         existing
│   ├── miller-web/              NEW — this spec
│   └── brand/                   NEW — @white-owl/brand package
├── package.json                 workspace root — scripts updated
├── eslint.config.mjs            NEW — hoisted from per-app
└── docs/superpowers/…
```

Workspace-root `package.json` scripts:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "npm run dev:tl49",
  "dev:tl49": "npm run dev --workspace=transline49-web",
  "dev:miller": "npm run dev --workspace=miller-web",
  "build": "npm run build --workspaces --if-present",
  "start": "npm run start --workspace=transline49-web",
  "lint": "eslint apps/**/*.{js,jsx,mjs}"
}
```

### 1.2 `@white-owl/brand` — `apps/brand/`

Source-shipped (no build step). Consumer's SWC transpiles JSX + CSS at
build time. Avoids dual-package hazard, dist/sync, ESM/CJS interop.

`apps/brand/package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "@white-owl/brand",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "exports": {
    "./styles/globals.css": "./styles/globals.css",
    "./components": "./components/index.js",
    "./tweaks": "./tweaks/index.js"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "next": "^16",
    "react": "^19",
    "react-dom": "^19"
  }
}
```

`peerDependencies` (not `dependencies`) is load-bearing — two React copies
on a future `npm install` would cause "Invalid hook call".

#### Both consuming apps require:

In `next.config.mjs`:
```js
transpilePackages: ["@white-owl/brand"]
```
(Without this, Next 16 refuses to compile JSX from a workspace package.)

In `app/layout.jsx`:
```js
import "@white-owl/brand/styles/globals.css";
```
(No CSS `@import` — Next 16's CSS pipeline doesn't `@import` from `node_modules`
packages cleanly.)

In `package.json` `dependencies`:
```json
"@white-owl/brand": "*"
```
(Symlink resolution fails silently otherwise.)

#### Intra-package imports must be relative.

`@/` alias inside the shared package resolves to the **consumer's** root and
breaks. No exceptions.

#### ESLint hoisted to repo root.

`<repo root>/eslint.config.mjs` runs `eslint apps/**/*.{js,jsx,mjs}`. The
existing per-app config at `apps/transline49-web/eslint.config.mjs` is
deleted. Per-app `lint` scripts are removed; only the root `npm run lint`
exists. IDE plugins (VS Code) auto-discover the root flat config.

#### Tweaks panel gated to non-production at import site.

```js
// apps/<app>/app/layout.jsx
{process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" && <SiteTweaksProvider />}
```
That's render-site gating which leaves the bundle. To get a true zero-KB
production payload, the import itself is gated:
```js
const SiteTweaksProvider =
  process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"
    ? (await import("@white-owl/brand/tweaks")).SiteTweaksProvider
    : null;
```
Done at the top of layout.jsx as a top-level await; Next 16 supports it in
server components. Production bundle has zero `tweaks/` references.
Phase-1 verification: `grep -r "twk-" .next/static/chunks/` after a prod
build returns nothing.

#### Exports

| Export | Source | Notes |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| `./styles/globals.css` | `apps/brand/styles/globals.css` | Design tokens, base, `tl-*` component selectors. Lifted verbatim from `apps/transline49-web/app/globals.css`. |
| `./components` | `ParallelRule`, `Marquee`, `SectionHead`, `FAQ`, `TrustBar`, `Icon`, `HeroPhoto`, `PageHero`, `ServiceCard`, `ScrollReveal`, `FormField` | Generic primitives. `ServiceCard` takes `href` so each app supplies its own routes. |
| `./tweaks` | `useTweaks`, `TweaksPanel`, `TweakSection`/`Radio`/`Select`, `SiteTweaksProvider` | Dev-only. Hard-coded localStorage key per app — TL49 uses `tweaks:tl49`, Miller uses `tweaks:miller`. No namespace factory; two separate provider instantiations. |

App-specific components stay per-app:
- TransLine49°: `TopNav`, `SiteFooter`, `Logomark`, `BorderMap`, `ProcessFlow`.
- Miller: `TopNav`, `SiteFooter`, `Logomark`, `EmergencyBanner`,
  `MillerProcessFlow`, `LocationCard`, `CertificationGrid`,
  `AffiliationsGrid`, `CaseStudyCard`.

(`FamilyOfCompanies` cross-link footer module is **deferred to phase 5**
— it requires touching the TL49 footer, the parent group has not provided
final ownership-line copy, and Miller can launch with a normal footer.)

### 1.4 Routes

- **26 real routes** (1:1 with the scrape).
- **6 stub routes** generated by `[slug]` (4 case-study slugs) and
  `[position]` (2 career slugs) via `generateStaticParams`. Stubs render
  `PageHero` + "More detail coming · contact us" + form CTA. They exist to
  prevent 404s on internal links.

**Total prerendered: 26 + 6 = 32**, distinguished as `26 real + 6 stub`
everywhere it's referenced.

---

## 2. Information architecture

### 2.1 Three user journeys

- **A — Emergency caller.** Wants the 24/7 number, fast. Solved by
  `EmergencyBanner` on the routes where emergencies originate (§2.4).
- **B — Industrial procurement.** Multi-visit vendor evaluation. Wants ISO
  certifications, VBEC licensure, capability depth, case studies. Solved by
  trust signals above the fold on home + service pages (§3).
- **C — Job seeker.** Wants employer brand, benefits, openings. Solved by a
  dedicated `CareersTemplate` with narrative spine (§3.7).

### 2.2 Primary nav

| Label | URL | Type |
| ----- | --- | ---- |
| Services | `/industrial-services/` | mega-menu, 10 children |
| About | `/about-us/` | dropdown, 5 children |
| Locations | `/treatment-facility/` | dropdown, 2 children |
| Case Studies | `/case-studies/` | direct |
| Careers | `/careers/` | dropdown, 2 children |
| Contact | `/contact-us/` | direct |

**`Processes` is removed from the primary nav.** The single child page
(Disposal of Inorganic Oxidizers) is narratively a specialised operating
detail of Industrial Waste Treatment — the round-2 content critic was right
that a one-item dropdown signals "we ran out of structure." The route
remains at `/processes/disposal-of-inorganic-oxidizers/` (SEO equity
preservation), but its discovery surface moves to a
"Specialised Processes" link block on Industrial Waste Treatment. If R&D
publishes a second process page, the top-level slot can be restored.

### 2.3 Footer

`<SiteFooter>` (Miller-specific): four columns (Services / Company /
Locations / Contact) + social row. The `FamilyOfCompanies` cross-link
strip is deferred to phase 5 (see §1.2).

### 2.4 `EmergencyBanner` — scoped route allow-list

Rendered above `TopNav` only on routes where Journey A originates:
- **Shown:** `/`, all `/industrial-services/*`, `/treatment-facility/`
- **Hidden:** `/about-us/*`, `/careers/*`, `/case-studies/*`, `/contact-us/`,
  `/winnipeg-service-centre/`, `/processes/*`

Banner state persists for the session via cookie (server-readable so SSR
emits the correct initial state and there's no hydration flash). Mobile
collapses to an icon button with
`aria-label="Call 24/7 emergency: (204) 957-6327"`.

### 2.5 Persistent header CTAs

- **General CTA:** "Contact Miller" → `/contact-us/` in `TopNav` right slot.
- Phone (general) `(204) 925-9600` in `TopNav` on ≥md viewports.

---

## 3. Page templates

Six templates + two specials.

### 3.1 `HomeTemplate` — `/`

Sequence (reordered after round-2 content review; VBEC promoted from step 6
to step 4 — procurement journey wants to *see the facility*):

1. **Hero** — carousel (3 photos), headline, subhead, two CTAs (Contact +
   tel:).
2. **Trust strip** — eyebrow line *"The only hazardous waste management
   company in Canada with an integrated management system featuring three
   ISO certifications"* + 4-card `CertificationGrid` (ISO 9001:2015 /
   14001:2015 / 45001:2018 / **MHCA COR 2023**) + "Over 25 Years" tagline.
3. **Services grid — 10 cards** via `ServiceCard`. Reordered:
   Industrial Waste Treatment first (the flagship operating story per the
   round-2 content critic), then Environmental Remediation, then Emergency
   Response, then the rest alphabetical.
4. **Our Facility (VBEC)** — promoted from step 6. Eyebrow names "Vaughn
   Bullough Environmental Centre", 7-capability list from
   `19-location-treatment-facility.md`, CTA to `/treatment-facility/`. The
   eyebrow also tells the *person* story in one line ("named for the
   General Manager who built it"), pointing at the About page for the full
   account.
5. **"For Over 25 Years"** editorial block (verbatim from scrape).
6. **Our Mission** + CTA to Core Values.
7. **"Join The Miller Family"** recruitment block.
8. **Marquee** with the brand refrains.
9. **Final CTA** — emergency phone + Contact Miller.

(Note: the `Statistics` section is **deleted**, not stubbed — see Non-goals.)

### 3.2 `ServiceDetailTemplate` — two variants

Round-2 content critic correctly flagged that 10 service pages with
wildly different copy depths cannot share one template. Two variants
declared in `lib/services.js` and dispatched by the template:

**`compact` variant** (`Customer Waste Collection`, `Industrial Cleaning`,
`Project Management`, `Stewardship`, `Vacuum Truck`):
- `PageHero`.
- One lead paragraph + one or two prose sections.
- Optional bullet list block.
- "Related Services" 3-card rail.

**`capabilities` variant** (`Industrial Waste Treatment` — flagship — plus
`Emergency Response`, `Research & Development`, `Specialty Recycling`):
- `PageHero` with optional CTA row.
- Lead paragraph.
- **Grouped capability sections** — for Treatment, the 6 processing
  categories (Specialty Soil / Inorganic / Liquid Organic / Solid Organic /
  Special Waste / Misc Processing) become collapsible group blocks with
  bullet lists. Other capabilities pages get the same shape with fewer
  groups.
- Inline trust badge near the lead: the "only in Canada" claim verbatim
  (see Deliberate Repetition list in §5.4).
- "Related Services" 3-card rail.

Both variants suppress their own emergency CTA when the sitewide
`EmergencyBanner` is shown on the route (avoids duplication on Remediation
and others).

### 3.3 `RemediationTemplate` — `/industrial-services/environmental-remediation-services/`

Bespoke — the live site's most marketing-driven page:
- `PageHero` + 2 CTAs.
- 6-card "What We Do" grid.
- Industries served bullet list.
- 5-step process — rendered as **`<ol>`** with `<li>` per stage.
- Case-study rail (4 cards).
- "Why Choose Miller" 4-card grid.
- Callback form (`FormField` from shared; on submit-with-errors,
  programmatically focus the first invalid input).

### 3.4 `ProcessTemplate` — `/processes/disposal-of-inorganic-oxidizers/`

`PageHero` + 4-card highlights + descriptive prose + `FAQ` + CTA.

### 3.5 `AboutTemplate` — `/about-us/` + 5 sub-pages

- `PageHero`.
- Prose + lists.
- `/about-us/` includes a dedicated **"The Vaughn Bullough story"** section
  preserving the renaming-announcement framing from `13-about.md`: Bullough
  joined as GM in 1997, the facility was renamed for him by President & CEO
  Blair McArthur. VBEC is a person, not just an acronym.
- `/about-us/quality-assurance/` hero `lead` = the verbatim *"only
  hazardous waste management company in Canada with an integrated management
  system featuring three ISO certifications"*. `CertificationGrid` renders
  beneath the lead.
- `/about-us/licencing-information/`: cert/license cards declare
  `{ name, code, href, sizeKB }`; link text formats as
  `"VBEC Processing Facility Operating Licence · PDF, 0.2 MB"`.
- `/about-us/professional-affiliations/`: 10-card `AffiliationsGrid`. TL49
  entry is a real cross-link.
- `/about-us/vision-mission-and-core-values/`: 4-card core-values grid.

### 3.6 `LocationTemplate` — `/treatment-facility/`, `/winnipeg-service-centre/`

- `PageHero` with facility imagery. Treatment-facility hero headline
  includes the full **"Vaughn Bullough Environmental Centre"** name with a
  one-line "named for…" subhead.
- Address card with `<iframe>` to
  `https://www.google.com/maps?...&output=embed` (`loading="lazy"`,
  `referrerPolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"`).
- Capabilities list.
- Contact card.

### 3.7 `CareersTemplate` — `/careers/` (not `IndexTemplate`)

Round-2 content critic flagged that a bare card grid for two job openings
reads as "we are not hiring." Real narrative spine:
- `PageHero`.
- "Why Miller" 4-card with the four core values (Respect / Empowerment &
  Accountability / Teamwork / Healthy Work Environment).
- "Open Positions" — 2 cards linking to the stub `[position]/page.jsx`.
- Benefits teaser (links to `/careers/benefits-rewards/`).
- DEI block (verbatim from `24-careers-working-at-miller.md`).
- "Send your resume to hr@millerenvironmental.mb.ca" close.

`/careers/benefits-rewards/` and `/careers/working-at-miller/` keep
`AboutTemplate` (prose + lists).

### 3.8 `IndexTemplate` — `/case-studies/` only

`PageHero` + 4-card grid linking to stub detail routes.

### 3.9 `ContactTemplate` — `/contact-us/`

`PageHero` + 3 cards (Phone / Office / Project Intake — the third is the
24/7 number, replacing the suppressed banner) + single-step form.

---

## 4. Visual language

### 4.1 Palette

Shared `globals.css` defines five `[data-palette]` themes. Miller's default
is **`deep`** with **full token override** so it doesn't render on TL49's
warm cream:

```css
[data-palette="deep"] {
  --c-bg: #F2F4F6;
  --c-surface: #FFFFFF;
  --c-ink: #0A1620;
  --c-ink-2: #2B3C48;
  --c-ink-3: #6B7C88;
  --c-line: #DCE3E8;
  --c-line-2: #E8EEF2;
  --c-navy: #06141B;
  --c-blue: #0E3A4D;
  --c-accent: #2EBFA5;
  --c-amber: #E3A857;
  --c-on-navy: #E6EEF2;
}
```

### 4.2 Eyebrow motif

TL49's `ParallelRule` encodes the 49°N motif (cross-border iconography
Miller doesn't share). Round-2 pragmatist + skeptic both flagged the
`motif="parallel-49"|"cert-tick"|"vbec-coord"` enum as architecture for
brand decoration — overbuilt for two brands.

**Resolution:** `ParallelRule` does not take a prop. CSS selectors gate the
motif by `data-brand` on the consumer's `<html>` element:
```css
[data-brand="miller"] .tl-parallel__tick::before { content: "✓"; }
```
TL49 sets `data-brand="tl49"`, Miller sets `data-brand="miller"`. Adding a
third brand later is one more CSS rule, not a new component API.

### 4.3 Typography — production ships two families, period

Production loads **Geist + Geist Mono only.** The lazy-load-alternate-fonts
mechanism from v2 is dropped — round-2 skeptic was right that dynamic
`@font-face` injection in a Next 16 RSC app is unproven in this stack and
not worth the foot-gun.

Alternate families (Newsreader, Manrope, Funnel Display, JetBrains Mono)
exist only in `npm run dev` and only when the env flag
`NEXT_PUBLIC_FONTS=all` is set. The dev `<head>` reads:
```jsx
{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FONTS === "all" && (
  <link rel="stylesheet" href={GOOGLE_FONTS_FULL_HREF} />
)}
```
Production never includes the link. Designers preview alternates via
`NEXT_PUBLIC_FONTS=all npm run dev:miller` locally.

Preload only Geist 400 + Geist Mono 400.

### 4.4 Photography

`lib/photos.js` registers Unsplash IDs. External `<img>` with eslint-disable
(same pattern TL49 uses). No `next/image` (keeps build fully static, no
domain config).

**Fallback for removed Unsplash IDs** (round-2 skeptic gap): `<HeroPhoto>`
accepts a `fallbackBg` CSS gradient prop. If the registered ID 404s in
production, the gradient fills the slot and rules out a broken hero.
Templates declare a sensible per-page gradient based on the
palette's `--c-navy → --c-blue` ramp.

### 4.5 Miller-specific components

- **`EmergencyBanner`** — `<aside role="region" aria-label="24-hour emergency contact">` with `tel:` link followed by dismiss button. Cookie-gated SSR initial state. Sticky with reserved height + `dvh` units for iOS Safari address-bar resilience. See §6, §7.
- **`MillerProcessFlow`** — 5-step Assessment → Containment → Excavation → Treatment → Verification timeline used on Remediation. Renders as `<ol>`.
- **`LocationCard`** — homepage locations cross-link + dropdown.
- **`CertificationGrid`** — 4-card display (ISO 9001 / 14001 / 45001 / MHCA COR 2023). Each card links to a real PDF; link text
  `"ISO 9001:2015 certificate · PDF, 0.3 MB"`.
- **`AffiliationsGrid`** — 10-card org grid.
- **`CaseStudyCard`** — used on Remediation + Case Studies.

### 4.6 Carousel — concrete CSS spec

Round-2 pragmatist asked for a concrete sketch. Three stacked layers, one
animation, holds frame 1 for 3s of a 12s cycle, reduced-motion freezes:

```css
.tl-hero__carousel { position: relative; }
.tl-hero__frame { position: absolute; inset: 0; opacity: 0; animation: tl-carousel 12s linear infinite; }
.tl-hero__frame--1 { animation-delay: 0s; }
.tl-hero__frame--2 { animation-delay: -8s; }
.tl-hero__frame--3 { animation-delay: -4s; }

@keyframes tl-carousel {
  0%, 25% { opacity: 1; }   /* hold 3s (= 25% of 12s) */
  33%, 92% { opacity: 0; }
  100% { opacity: 1; }       /* fade back in just before next cycle */
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .tl-hero__frame { animation: none; }
  .tl-hero__frame--1 { opacity: 1; }
  .tl-hero__frame--2, .tl-hero__frame--3 { display: none; }
}
```
Frame 1 has `fetchpriority="high"`; frames 2 + 3 are `loading="lazy"`.

### 4.7 Animation

ScrollReveal inherits from shared. **Honours
`@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`** — no observer attached, all
elements rendered visible.

---

## 5. Implementation rules

### 5.1 Stack
- **JSX (not TSX).** Match TL49.
- **Server components by default.** Client islands: `TopNav`,
  `EmergencyBanner`, `FAQ`, `ContactForm`, `RemediationCallback`,
  `ScrollReveal`, `SiteTweaksProvider` + panel (dev-only).
- **Content lives in `lib/content/`.** **Plain strings + arrays only.** No
  JSX inside content modules — if inline `<strong>` is needed, it lives in
  the template, not the content. Round-2 pragmatist flagged that a content
  layer that allows JSX becomes components-in-disguise and loses the
  "templates render plain data" guarantee.

### 5.2 Don't ship invented numbers
- StatsBand section is deleted.
- ISO cert hrefs that resolve to `"#"` are forbidden at lint time
  (eslint `no-restricted-syntax`) and grep-checked on `lib/certs.js` in CI.

### 5.3 Maps
- `<iframe>` to Google Maps embed URL. `loading="lazy"`. No JS map library.

### 5.4 Deliberate repetition list (centralised in `lib/content/brand.js`)

Phrases that appear on multiple pages by design, sourced once:

| Phrase | Appears on |
| ------ | ---------- |
| **"Over 25 years"** | Home trust eyebrow; Remediation lead; About hero; service-page leads (optional) |
| **"Safe, dependable, and on-time service"** | Home hero subhead; footer tagline; contact-page hero |
| **"The only hazardous waste management company in Canada with an integrated management system featuring three ISO certifications"** | Home trust eyebrow; QA hero; inline trust badge on the 5 regulated-service pages (Treatment, Remediation, Emergency Response, Stewardship, Specialty Recycling) |
| **"Cradle to grave"** | Home editorial block (verbatim); QA tracking section (verbatim). Nowhere else — repetition past two locations dilutes it. |
| **24/7 emergency `(204) 957-6327`** | `EmergencyBanner` (every shown route); Contact-page Phone card. Not in service-page body copy. |
| **"Vaughn Bullough Environmental Centre (VBEC)"** | Full name once per page on first use, then "VBEC". Treatment Facility + About pages keep the full name in headlines. |

### 5.5 Voice & tone

Miller voice: **dry, technical, slightly institutional** — the voice of a
30-year operator who runs a licensed facility. Short declarative sentences.
Capability lists over narrative paragraphs. Named certifications over
adjectives ("ISO 45001:2018", not "rigorously safe"). Compare to TL49's
editorial cadence ("the 49th parallel runs through every shipment") —
Miller deliberately doesn't reach for that.

Two exceptions, where one editorial register is allowed: the VBEC renaming

## 6. Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)

- **Skip link target** = `<main id="main" tabIndex={-1}>` on every page. Skip
  link href `#main`. Skip link is first focusable on every route.
- **EmergencyBanner semantics**: `<aside role="region" aria-label="24-hour emergency contact">`. Phone link first, dismiss button second. Banner sits before skip-link's `<main>` destination in tab order; skip link bypasses it.
- **Mobile banner icon** announces full phone number.
- **Cert + licence download links** include type + size and `<a download>`.
  Build-time check: eslint `no-restricted-syntax` forbids
  `JSXAttribute[name.name="href"][value.value="#"]` in JSX; CI greps
  `lib/certs.js` for `href: "#"`. Both fail the build.
- **5-step process timeline = `<ol>`.** Non-negotiable.
- **Form a11y.** Reuse shared `FormField` (`useId`, `htmlFor`,
  `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`, `role="alert"`, visually-hidden
  "(required)"). On submit-with-errors, programmatically focus the first
  invalid input.
- **Reduced motion.** ScrollReveal + carousel honour `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- **Mobile nav drawer.** Inherits TL49's focus trap + body-scroll lock.
- **Colour contrast.** `deep` palette passes WCAG AA at 4.5:1 for body text
  and 3:1 for ≥18 px headings — re-audited in phase 5.

## 7. Performance

Round-2 skeptic was right that v2's per-route JS budgets were invented.
This spec **targets, doesn't gate** — phase-5 measurement decides whether
budget thresholds make it into CI.

### Targets (aspirational, measured at phase 5)
- Thin pages: ~120 KB first-load JS (compressed).
- Rich pages (Home, Remediation, Treatment, Contact): ~180 KB.
- LCP measured via **Lighthouse mobile preset (Moto G Power, Slow 4G)** on
  `/` and `/industrial-services/environmental-remediation-services/`.
  Target ≤ 2.5 s. Anything > 3.0 s is a phase-5 fix item.

### Practical commits (do, not measure)
- `<link rel="preconnect" href="https://images.unsplash.com" crossorigin />` in `<head>`.
- `<link rel="preload" as="image" fetchpriority="high" href="<hero-frame-1>" />`.
- Carousel frame 1 has `fetchpriority="high"`; frames 2 + 3 `loading="lazy"`.
- All routes prerendered as static HTML (no SSR).
- Tweaks panel **import-site gated** to non-prod — zero bytes in production.
- Two font families only in prod.

### CLS budget
- < 0.05. `EmergencyBanner` uses `position: sticky; top: 0` inside a wrapper
  with reserved `min-block-size` and `dvh` units to absorb iOS address-bar
  shifts.

## 8. SEO / metadata

- Per-route `metadata` exports sourced from `lib/content/*`.
- `app/sitemap.js` enumerates the 32 prerendered routes.
- `robots.txt` allows all.
- OG image `/og.png` placeholder.
- Title template `"%s · Miller Environmental"`.

## 9. Phasing

Five phases in `docs/superpowers/specs/miller-web-phase-NN.md`.

| Phase | Theme | Intra-phase parallelism |
| ----- | ----- | ----------------------- |
| 01 | Foundation: shared package extraction + workspace rewire | Sequential (each step gates the next) |
| 02 | Miller components + page templates | **Parallel** — 5 component/template clusters, no inter-dependencies |
| 03 | Thin pages (10 services, 5 about subs, 2 locations, indexes, contact) | **Parallel** — page-per-task |
| 04 | Rich pages (Home, Treatment, Remediation, Quality Assurance, Careers) | **Parallel** — page-per-task |
| 05 | Polish: stub routes, SEO, a11y/perf audit, lint clean, local commit | Sequential — verification gates |

Phases 02-04 are parallel-friendly. The user's instruction
("structure it so any phase-plans that can be executed in parallel … are
put in the earlier phase-plans") is satisfied: foundation must come first
by definition, then three parallel phases, then sequential polish.

## 10. Open questions (deferred, not blocking)

1. **Real ISO PDFs + Miller logomark + VBEC imagery clearance** — who supplies, and when? Phase 1 ships with placeholder hrefs and the build-time check off; phase 5 turns the check on.
2. **`FamilyOfCompanies` ownership-line copy** — parent group hasn't approved the cross-link strip; deferred to phase 5.
3. **Staging URL + preview-deploy gating** — out of scope for this spec; the user has explicitly said all commits stay local for now.
4. **TL49 footer edit timing** — needs a small change to host the
   `FamilyOfCompanies` strip when phase 5 lands. Until then, TL49 ships
   unchanged.

---

## 11. Phase-01 hard prerequisites

Before any Miller page can render in dev, **in this order, each gated by
the next**:

1. **Update workspaces glob → `["apps/*", "apps/shared/*"]` OR relocate brand to `apps/brand/`.** Spec adopts the latter. Update root `package.json`.
2. **Create `apps/brand/`** with extracted CSS + components (no class rename). `package.json` lists `peerDependencies`.
3. **Add `"@white-owl/brand": "*"` to both apps' dependencies.** Add `transpilePackages: ["@white-owl/brand"]` to TL49's `next.config.mjs`. Replace TL49's `app/layout.jsx` CSS import.
4. **Run `npm install` at root**, verify symlink at `apps/transline49-web/node_modules/@white-owl/brand`.
5. **TL49 still builds + matches visually** (manual diff).
6. **Hoist ESLint to root.** Move deps to root `devDependencies`. Write root `eslint.config.mjs`. Delete `apps/transline49-web/eslint.config.mjs` and the per-app lint script. Verify `npm run lint` at root passes.
7. **Move tweaks into `@white-owl/brand`** with import-site gating on `NODE_ENV !== "production"`. Verify production build of TL49 has zero `twk-*` references in client chunks (`grep -r "twk-" .next/static/chunks/`).
8. **Scaffold `apps/miller-web/`** skeleton: `package.json`, `next.config.mjs` (with `transpilePackages`), `app/layout.jsx` (with shared CSS import), `app/page.jsx` (empty placeholder). Verify `npm run dev:miller` boots and root `npm run build` builds both apps.

Anything beyond step 8 is phase 2.

## 12. Decision log — round-2 disposition

**A** = adopted · **D** = deferred · **R** = rejected. Round-1 dispositions
already merged into the spec body and not re-listed here.

### From Skeptical Reviewer
| # | Objection | Disposition |
| - | --------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Drop the `tl-*` → `wo-*` rename | **A** Non-goals + §1.2 — sed is vanity. |
| 2 | 120/180 KB budgets are invented | **A** §7 — converted to *targets measured at phase 5*, not CI gates. |
| 3 | Lazy `@font-face` injection is unproven | **A** §4.3 — dropped. Prod ships two families. Alternates only via dev env flag. |
| 4 | LCP < 2.0s on "4G" has no device/tool | **A** §7 — replaced with Lighthouse mobile preset (Moto G Power, Slow 4G), ≤ 2.5s LCP target. |
| 5 | `motif` enum is brand-decoration architecture | **A** §4.2 — dropped prop entirely; use `data-brand` CSS selectors. Killed `vbec-coord`. |
| 6 | 32-routes count conflates real with stubs | **A** §1.4 — explicitly `26 real + 6 stub`. |
| 7 | Tweaks namespace factory unsolved | **A** §1.2 — dropped factory; hard-code keys per app. |
| 8 | Unsplash photo-removal has no fallback | **A** §4.4 — `<HeroPhoto>` accepts `fallbackBg` gradient. |

### From Implementation Pragmatist
| # | Friction | Disposition |
| - | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 | `tl-*` rename is 144 tokens + keyframes + data attrs | **A** Rename dropped (see Skeptic #1). |
| 2 | Workspace glob `apps/*` not recursive | **A** §1.1 — package relocated to `apps/brand/`. |
| 3 | `@white-owl/brand` install ordering | **A** §11 — phase-01 prerequisites named in order with gates. |
| 4 | Bundle-budget CI gate doesn't exist | **A** §7 — demoted to manual phase-5 check using `next build` console output + Lighthouse. |
| 5 | Build-time `href="#"` check unwritten | **A** §6 — replaced with eslint `no-restricted-syntax` + CI grep on `lib/certs.js`. |
| 6 | Carousel needs concrete CSS | **A** §4.6 — full sketch in spec. |
| 7 | `lib/content/*` becomes JSX-in-disguise | **A** §5.1 — content modules constrained to plain strings + arrays. |
| 8 | Drop `Processes` top-nav | **A** §2.2 — removed from primary nav; route preserved. |
| 9 | Drop `motif` prop | **A** §4.2 — see Skeptic #5. |
| 10 | Drop Tweaks namespace factory | **A** see Skeptic #7. |
| 11 | Defer `FamilyOfCompanies` to phase 5 | **A** §2.3 + §1.2. |
| 12 | Cut `StatsBand` entirely | **A** Non-goals + §3.1. |

### From Content Strategist
| # | Concern | Disposition |
| - | ------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Industrial Waste Treatment is the operating flagship, not Remediation | **A** §3.2 — `capabilities` variant for Treatment; Remediation keeps bespoke template; Treatment is card-1 on home services grid. |
| 2 | VBEC is a person, not an acronym | **A** §3.5 + §3.6 — dedicated "Vaughn Bullough story" section on About; treatment-facility hero says "named for…". |
| 3 | Home ordering buries VBEC | **A** §3.1 — VBEC promoted to step 4 (after services grid). |
| 4 | `ServiceDetailTemplate` Procrustean | **A** §3.2 — `compact` + `capabilities` variants; service variant declared in `lib/services.js`. |
| 5 | Processes top-nav indefensible | **A** §2.2 — folded; route preserved. |
| 6 | Careers needs narrative spine | **A** §3.7 — `CareersTemplate` replaces `IndexTemplate` for `/careers/`. |
| 7 | "Only in Canada" claim should repeat on regulated-service pages | **A** §5.4 — added to deliberate repetition list. |
| Voice | Industrial, declarative, institutional | **A** §5.5. |
| Repetition list | Centralise refrains in `lib/content/brand.js` | **A** §5.4 — table added. |
